/**
 * A **Traversal** is a versatile optic that can focus on zero or more parts 'A' within a larger
 * structure 'S'. Think of it as a functional "search-and-replace" or a bulk update tool üó∫Ô∏è.
 *
 * <p>A Traversal is the right tool for "has-many" relationships, such as operating on every element
 * in a {@code List} or {@code Set}. It is the most general of the core optics, capable of modifying
 * all focused parts simultaneously within an {@link Applicative} context.
 *
 * <p>Both {@link Lens} and {@link Prism} can be viewed as specialized {@code Traversal}s:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@code Lens} is a {@code Traversal} that focuses on exactly one item.
 *   <li>A {@code Prism} is a {@code Traversal} that focuses on zero or one item.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It extends the generic {@link Optic}, specializing it for {@code S = T} and {@code A = B}.
 *
 * @param <S> The type of the whole structure (e.g., a {@code List<User>}).
 * @param <A> The type of the focused parts (e.g., the {@code User} elements).

   *
   * <p>The {@link Applicative} instance is crucial as it defines how to combine the results of

   * Validated}, or run in parallel for a concurrent data type).
