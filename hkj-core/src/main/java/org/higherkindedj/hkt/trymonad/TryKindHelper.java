/**
 * A utility class providing static helper methods for working with {@link Try} in the context of
 * Higher-Kinded Type (HKT) simulation.
 *
 * <p>This class facilitates the conversion between the concrete {@link Try} type and its HKT
 * representation {@link Kind}&lt;{@link TryKind.Witness}, A&gt; (which is what {@link
 * TryKind}&lt;A&gt; effectively is). It offers methods for:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Wrapping a {@link Try} into a {@link TryKind}.
 *   <li>Unwrapping a {@link TryKind} back to a {@link Try}.
 *   <li>Convenience factory methods for creating {@link TryKind} instances representing {@link
 *       Try.Success} or {@link Try.Failure}, or from a {@link Supplier}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The HKT marker (witness type) used for {@code Try} is {@link TryKind.Witness}. This class is
 * final and cannot be instantiated.
 *
 * @see Try
 * @see TryKind
 * @see TryKind.Witness
