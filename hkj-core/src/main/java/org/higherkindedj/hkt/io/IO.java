/**
 * Represents a computation that, when executed, can perform side effects and produce a value of
 * type {@code A}. The {@code IO} monad is a core pattern in functional programming for isolating
 * and managing side effects (e.g., network requests, file system operations, database calls,
 * console I/O) in a controlled manner.
 *
 * <p>An {@code IO<A>} instance does not perform any action when it's created. Instead, it acts as a
 * description or a "recipe" for a computation that will be executed only when explicitly
 * instructed, typically by calling {@link #unsafeRunSync()}. This deferred execution allows for
 * referential transparency and enables building complex effectful programs that remain testable and
 * composable.
 *
 * <p><b>Key Characteristics:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Laziness:</b> Effects are not executed upon creation of an {@code IO} value, but only
 *       when explicitly run.
 *   <li><b>Purity:</b> Constructing and combining {@code IO} values are pure operations. The
 *       impurity (side effect) is deferred until execution.
 *   <li><b>Composability:</b> {@code IO} operations can be easily chained and combined using
 *       methods like {@link #map(Function)} and {@link #flatMap(Function)} to build more complex
 *       effectful workflows.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Describes reading a line from the console
 * IO<String> readLine = IO.delay(() -> {
 * System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
 * return new java.util.Scanner(System.in).nextLine();
 * });
 *
 * // Describes printing a string to the console
 * IO<Void> printLine(String message) {
 * return IO.delay(() -> {
 * System.out.println(message);
 * return null; // Void actions typically return null
 * });
 * }
 *
 * // Combine descriptions
 * IO<Void> greetUser = readLine.flatMap(name ->
 * printLine("Hello, " + name + "!")
 * );
 *
 * // Nothing has happened yet.
 * // To actually perform the I/O:
 * // greetUser.unsafeRunSync(); // This will prompt for input and then print the greeting.
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The name {@code unsafeRunSync} highlights that executing the {@code IO} operation can have
 * side effects and, in a synchronous context, may block. In more advanced scenarios, {@code IO}
 * types often provide asynchronous execution methods (e.g., {@code unsafeRunAsync}).
 *
 * @param <A> The type of the value produced by the computation when it is executed. For {@code IO}
 *     actions that don't produce a meaningful value (e.g., printing to console), {@link Void} is
 *     often used as the type parameter {@code A}.
