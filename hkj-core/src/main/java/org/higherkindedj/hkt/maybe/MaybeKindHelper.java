/**
 * A utility class providing static helper methods for working with {@link MaybeKind} in the context
 * of Higher-Kinded Type (HKT) simulation.

 * <p>This class facilitates the conversion between the concrete {@link Maybe} type and its HKT
 * representation {@link Kind}&lt;{@link MaybeKind.Witness}, A&gt; (which is what {@link
 * MaybeKind}&lt;A&gt; effectively is). It offers methods for:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Wrapping a {@link Maybe} into a {@link MaybeKind}.
 *   <li>Unwrapping a {@link MaybeKind} back to a {@link Maybe}.
 *   <li>Convenience factory methods for creating {@link MaybeKind} instances representing {@link
 *       Just} or {@link Nothing}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * This class is final and cannot be instantiated.
