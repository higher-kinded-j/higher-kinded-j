/**
 * A higher-kinded type marker for the {@link StateT} monad transformer.
 *
 * <p>In the higher-kinded types (HKT) emulation provided by this library, Java's lack of native
 * type constructor polymorphism is addressed using "witness" types or marker interfaces like {@code
 * StateTKind}. This interface allows {@link StateT} to be treated abstractly in contexts requiring
 * HKTs.
 *
 * <p>A {@code StateT<S, F, A>} computation encapsulates a function that takes an initial state of
 * type {@code S} and produces a result of type {@code A} along with a new state, all within the
 * context of an underlying monad {@code F}.
 *
 * <p>This interface, {@code StateTKind<S, F, A>}, serves as a "kinded" version of {@code StateT<S,
 * F, A>}. It allows {@code StateT} to be treated as a type constructor {@code StateTKind.Witness<S,
 * F>} (or simply {@code StateT<S,F,?>} in conceptual terms). This constructor takes one type
 * argument {@code A} (the value type of the {@code StateT}'s computation) while keeping {@code S}
 * (the state type) and {@code F} (the underlying monad's witness type) fixed for a particular
 * "kinded" instance.
 *
 * <p>Specifically, when using {@code StateTKind} in generic HKT abstractions:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The "higher-kinded type witness" (often denoted as {@code Mu} or the type constructor
 *       itself) is {@link Witness Witness&lt;S, F&gt;}. This represents the {@code StateT} type
 *       constructor, partially applied with the state type {@code S} and the underlying monad
 *       witness {@code F}.
 *   <li>The "value type" (often denoted as {@code A}) is {@code A}, representing the primary result
 *       type of the computation encapsulated by the {@code StateT}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>An instance of {@code Kind<StateTKind.Witness<S, F>, A>} can be safely narrowed (cast) back to
 * a concrete {@code StateT<S, F, A>} using the static {@link #narrow(Kind)} method provided by this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>The nested {@code WitnessS} and {@code WitnessF} classes are alternative, less commonly used
 * witness types that fix only one of the {@code S} or {@code F} parameters, respectively. The
 * primary witness for HKT usage is {@link Witness Witness&lt;S, F&gt;}.
 *
 * @param <S> The type of the state threaded through the computations. This parameter is part of the
 *     primary witness type {@link Witness Witness&lt;S, F&gt;}.
 * @param <F> The higher-kinded type witness for the underlying monad (e.g., {@code
 *     OptionalKind.Witness}, {@code ListKind.Witness}). This parameter is also part of the primary
 *     witness type.
 * @param <A> The type of the value produced by the {@link StateT} computation. This is the type
 *     parameter that varies for the higher-kinded type.

 * @see StateTMonad
 * @see StateTKindHelper
