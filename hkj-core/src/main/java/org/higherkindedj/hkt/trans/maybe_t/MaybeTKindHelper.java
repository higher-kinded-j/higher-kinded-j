/**
 * A utility class for simulating higher-kinded types (HKT) with {@link MaybeT}. It provides methods
 * to safely wrap a concrete {@link MaybeT} instance into its {@link Kind} representation ({@code
 * Kind<MaybeTKind.Witness<F>, A>}) and to unwrap it back.
 *
 * <p>This helper is essential for using {@code MaybeT} with generic HKT abstractions like {@code
 * Monad<MaybeTKind.Witness<F>, A>}. Since {@link MaybeT} now directly implements {@link
 * MaybeTKind}, this helper primarily facilitates type casting and provides runtime safety checks.
 *
 * <p>This class is final and cannot be instantiated.
