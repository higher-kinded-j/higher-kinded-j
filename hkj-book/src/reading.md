# A Blog on Types and Functional Patterns

Here is a blog series providing some background reading that you may find interesting while learning some of the techniques used in Higher-Kinded-J.

This is a web series that brewed some of the ideas that kicked off Higher-Kinded-J

- [Algebraic Data Types and Pattern Matching with Java](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2025/01/20/algebraic-data-types-with-java.html)

In this post we explore the power of Algebraic Data Types(ADT) with Pattern Matching in Java. We look at how they help us model complex business domains and how using them together gives improvements on the traditional Visitor Pattern.

- [Variance in Generics, Phantom and Existential types with Java and Scala](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2025/02/17/variance-in-java-and-scala.html)

In this post we look at Variance in Generics and how it is handled in Java and Scala. We consider use-site and declaration-site approaches and the trade offs of erasure. Finally we take a look at Phantom and Existential types and how they can enhance the capabilities of the type system when it comes to modelling.

- [Intersection and Union types with Java and Scala](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2025/03/05/intersection-and-union-types-with-java-and-scala.html)

In this post we will see how Intersection types help us better model type constraints promoting reuse and how Union types increase code flexibility. We will compare and contrast approaches and how to use in the latest Java and Scala.

- [Functors and Monads with Java and Scala](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2025/03/31/functors-monads-with-java-and-scala.html)

Learn about how Functors and Monads provide patterns to write cleaner, more composable, and robust code that helps us deal with operations like handling nulls, managing errors and sequencing asynchronous actions.

- [Higher Kinded Types with Java and Scala](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2025/04/11/higher-kinded-types-with-java-and-scala.html)

In this post we will see how Higher Kinded Types types can help increase the flexibility of our code and reduce duplication.

- [Recursion, Thunks and Trampolines with Java and Scala](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2025/05/02/recursion-thunks-trampolines-with-java-and-scala.html)

In this post we will see how Thunks and Trampolines can help solve problems by converting deep stack-based recursion into heap-based iteration helping to prevent StackOverflowErrors
