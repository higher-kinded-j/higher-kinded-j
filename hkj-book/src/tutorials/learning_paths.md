## Combined Journeys

For longer learning sessions, these combinations work well together and stay under 60 minutes:

### Error Mastery (~56 min)
Combine [Core: Error Handling](coretypes/error_handling_journey.md) + [Core: Advanced Patterns](coretypes/advanced_journey.md)

Focus: Complete the error handling and advanced FP patterns in one sitting.

### DSL Power (~59 min)
Combine [Optics: Fluent & Free DSL](optics/fluent_free_journey.md) + [Optics: Focus DSL](optics/focus_dsl_journey.md)

Focus: Master both the Free Monad DSL and the Focus DSL together.

### Effect API Complete (~65 min)
Combine [Effect API: Fundamentals](effect/effect_journey.md) + [Effect API: Advanced](effect/effect_journey.md)

Focus: Master the complete Effect Path API from basics to advanced contexts and annotations.

## Tips for Success

1. **One journey per sitting**: Each journey is designed to be completed without interruption. Taking breaks between journeys helps consolidation.

2. **Don't skip the struggle**: When an exercise is hard, that's where learning happens. Consult solutions only after genuine effort.

3. **Run the tests**: The red-to-green feedback loop is essential. Don't just read the exercises.

4. **Revisit earlier journeys**: After completing later journeys, earlier concepts often make more sense. Circle back.

5. **Apply immediately**: After each journey, try using what you learned in your own code.
